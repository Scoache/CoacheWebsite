<p> The work of artist duo JODI can be understood as a programmatic artistic exploration
    of the computer and the net. 
</p>
    <br>
<p>
    Automatic Rain, one of their first works for the web browser, drew inspiration from the 
    timed sprinklers that kept Silicon Valley's lawns in perfect order.
    Playing out across three web pages, it made us a found image, a photograph,
    Netscape's blink feature, and the slow loading times of the mid 90s web to create a simple and lyrical composition.
</p>
    <br>
<p>
    Making productive use of the tension between digital technologies, which purport to offer
    seamlessness and precision, and the messiness of the world they exist within, Automatic Rain set up a dynamic which
    JODI continued to explore in a body of work that now spans decades. But because it relied heavily on its 
    technological context, it quickly ceased to function properly, and is now one among the lesser-known works from the artists.
