<h3>Background</h3>
    <p>Robert Adrian was a Canadian artist who moved from Canada to Vienna, Austria in 1972.
        He became known for creating experimental artworks using radio and communications technologies.
        One of his earliest telecommunication projects, in collaboration with Bill Bartlett,
        was a work that used the business computer network of the company I.P. Sharp Associates, 
        called Interplay, the piece was a telecommunications event that linked a dozen cities
        in Canada, the US, Australia, Austria and Japan on April 1, 1979. </p>
        <br>
<h3>Artwork</h3>
    <p>
        The World in 24 Hours was created in 1982.
        The World in 24 Hours was a networked happening that linked sixteen cities worldwide,
        with the media art festival Ars Electronica in Linz, Austria acting as the central node.
        Each site was given one hour in which to generate and transmit content over a wide range
        of devices and networks, including computer terminals, phone, fax, and slow-scan tv.
    </p>
    <p>
        Adrian incorporated the IPSA network into The World in 24 Hours.
        Terminals at a number of participating venues were used to connect to the 
        mainframe, printing out transmitted content directly to paper in the absense of a screen.
