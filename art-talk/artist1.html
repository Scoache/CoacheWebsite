    <p>Robert Adrian was a Canadian artist who moved from Canada to Vienna, Austria in 1972.
        <br>
    <p>
        The World in 24 Hours was created in 1982.
        The World in 24 Hours was a networked happening that linked sixteen cities worldwide,
        with the media art festival Ars Electronica in Linz, Austria acting as the central node.
        Each site was given one hour in which to generate and transmit content over a wide range
        of devices and networks, including computer terminals, phone, fax, and slow-scan tv.
    </p>
        <br>
    <p>
        Adrian incorporated the IPSA network into The World in 24 Hours.
        Terminals at a number of participating venues were used to connect to the 
        mainframe, printing out transmitted content directly to paper in the absense of a screen.
    </p>
        <br>
    <p>
        The World in 24 Hours set out a project of considering network technology
        in relation to existing sociocultural networks and practices.
        Although the technology itself has evolved considerably since it was performed,
        Adrian's underlying approach continues to be valid. In a sense, he anticipated a world in which many aspects of existance 
        would be shaped by communication networks.
